## 🎯 Improved Variants

### 1. **Checkpoint Challenge** (Improved)

**Before:**
- Must visit ALL 10 checkpoints
- Very long games
- Frustrating if you miss one

**After:**
- ✅ Only need **5 out of 10 checkpoints** (more achievable)
- ✅ **Starting bonus**: 2 power-ups + 50 coins
- ✅ **Cascading checkpoints**: Hitting one unlocks nearby ones
- ✅ **Passing through counts**: More forgiving (don't need exact landing)
- ✅ Games are **shorter** and **more fun**

**Cascading Effect:**
- Hit checkpoint 20 → Unlocks checkpoints 10, 30, 40 (easier to hit)
- Like Bejeweled: matching 4 unlocks nearby matches

---

### 2. **Alien Hunter** (Improved)

**Before:**
- 50 turns (too long)
- No combos
- Just counting kills

**After:**
- ✅ **30 turns** (shorter, faster games)
- ✅ **Starting bonus**: "Alien Magnet" power-up + 30 coins
- ✅ **Cascading kills**: Hitting aliens in a row = combo bonus
  - 2 kills in a row = 2x points
  - 3 kills in a row = 4x points
  - 4 kills in a row = 8x points (like Bejeweled!)
- ✅ **Combo multiplier**: Builds up for chain reactions

**Cascading Effect:**
- Kill alien → Next kill = 2x points
- Keep killing = multiplier grows
- Like Bejeweled: 4-in-a-row breaks all same color

---

### 3. **King of the Hill** (Improved)

**Before:**
- Need 3 turns on hill (too long)
- No starting help

**After:**
- ✅ **2 turns** on hill (faster win)
- ✅ **Starting bonus**: Shield + Skip Turn power-ups + 40 coins
- ✅ **Cascading defense**: Each turn on hill gives defense bonus
- ✅ More strategic, less waiting

---

### 4. **Power-Up Rush** (Improved)

**Before:**
- Just spawns power-ups
- No combos

**After:**
- ✅ **Starting bonus**: Power-Up Magnet + Combo Boost + 60 coins
- ✅ **Cascading power-ups**: Using same power-up type = combo
  - Use 2 shields in a row → Spawns bonus power-up
  - Use 3 moves in a row → Spawns 2 bonus power-ups
- ✅ **Combo chains**: Like Bejeweled cascades
- ✅ More variety each turn

**Cascading Effect:**
- Use power-up → Next same type = combo
- Combos spawn bonus power-ups
- Creates chain reactions

## 🎲 Cascading Mechanics (Like Bejeweled)

### How It Works:

**1. Alien Combo Chain:**
```
Turn 1: Hit alien → 1 kill
Turn 2: Hit alien → 2x COMBO! (2 kills)
Turn 3: Hit alien → 4x COMBO! (3 kills)
Turn 4: Hit alien → 8x COMBO! (4 kills) 🔥
```
Like Bejeweled: 4-in-a-row breaks all same color!

**2. Checkpoint Cascade:**
```
Hit checkpoint 20
  → Unlocks checkpoint 10 (easier to hit)
  → Unlocks checkpoint 30 (easier to hit)
  → Unlocks checkpoint 40 (easier to hit)
```
Like Bejeweled: matching unlocks nearby matches!

**3. Power-Up Combo:**
```
Use Shield → Use Shield → 2x COMBO!
  → Spawns bonus power-up
Use Move → Use Move → Use Move → 3x COMBO!
  → Spawns 2 bonus power-ups
```
Like Bejeweled: cascading matches create more matches!

- Combos create new power-ups
- Never the same setup
