Players unlock titles at milestones:

**Result:** New content unlocks = **always something to look forward to**

---

## 🎁 8. Season Pass (Premium Content)

**Free Track:** Basic rewards at levels 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
**Premium Track:** Enhanced rewards + exclusive cosmetics

**Result:** Premium users get double value = **monetization + retention**

---

## 📊 Retention Psychology

### Daily Habits
- Daily quests (level 3+) = log in daily
- Streak bonuses = don't break the chain
- Daily rewards = consistent micro-rewards

### Weekly Goals

- Tournament cycles = come back for competition
- Season pass levels = time-limited progression

### Social Proof
- Titles visible to others = flex your status
- Exclusive cosmetics = show off your grind
- Leaderboards = competitive motivation

### Sunk Cost
- Higher level = more invested
- Rare unlocks = don't want to lose progress
- Friend connections = community ties

- Skips dangerous sections

**Lucky Star:**
- Uses when exactly 6 spaces from checkpoint/finish
